## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
# Generate some sample data, then compute mean and standard deviation
# in each group
df <- data.frame(
  gp = factor(rep(letters[1:3], each = 10)),
  y = rnorm(30)
)
ds <- do.call(rbind, lapply(split(df, df$gp), function(d) {
  data.frame(mean = mean(d$y), sd = sd(d$y), gp = d$gp)
}))

# The summary data frame ds is used to plot larger red points on top
# of the raw data. Note that we don't need to supply `data` or `mapping`
# in each layer because the defaults from ggplot() are used.
ggplot(df, aes(gp, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = ds, aes(y = mean), colour = 'red', size = 3)

# Same plot as above, declaring only the data frame in ggplot().
# Note how the x and y aesthetics must now be declared in
# each geom_point() layer.
ggplot(df) +
  geom_point(aes(gp, y)) +
  geom_point(data = ds, aes(gp, mean), colour = 'red', size = 3)

# Alternatively we can fully specify the plot in each layer. This
# is not useful here, but can be more clear when working with complex
# mult-dataset graphics
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = df, aes(gp, y)) +
  geom_point(data = ds, aes(gp, mean), colour = 'red', size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(
    data = ds,
    aes(gp, mean, ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd),
    colour = 'red',
    width = 0.4
